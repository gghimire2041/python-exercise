    "## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of \"objects.\" These objects are instances of classes and serve as the fundamental building blocks of OOP. Here are some core principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objects:\n",
    "Objects in OOP represent real-world entities and consist of both data (attributes/properties) and behaviors (methods/functions) that operate on that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes:\n",
    "Classes act as blueprints or templates that define the structure and behavior of objects. They specify the attributes and methods an object will possess but are not the objects themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encapsulation:\n",
    "Encapsulation involves bundling data and related methods within a single unit (an object). It hides the internal state and mandates interaction with an object only through its defined methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance:\n",
    "Inheritance allows a class (subclass/derived class) to inherit properties and behavior from another class (superclass/base class). It promotes code reuse and hierarchy creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polymorphism:\n",
    "Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows a single interface for entities of various types and facilitates implementing different functionalities through a uniform interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How OOP Works:\n",
    "- **Objects**: They possess states (attributes) and behaviors (methods/functions).\n",
    "- **Classes**: They define blueprints/templates for creating objects.\n",
    "- **Abstraction**: Focuses on essential attributes and behaviors while hiding unnecessary details.\n",
    "- **Modularity**: OOP divides complex systems into smaller, manageable parts (objects/classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Languages such as Python, Java, C++, among others, support object-oriented programming. OOP organizes code, making it more structured, reusable, and easier to maintain and expand as software evolves.\n"
